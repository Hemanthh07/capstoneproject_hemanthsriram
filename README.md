About Data Set:

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
